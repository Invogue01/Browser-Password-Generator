# Browser-Password-Generator

## About

I have modified starter code to create an application that enables user to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected. This app will run in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code.

## Story

```
Randomly Generate password with specified criteria to create secure password
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN YOU click the button to generate a password
THEN YOU ARE presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN YOU select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN YOU choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN YOU confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN YOU answer each prompt
THEN YOUR input is validated and at least one character type is selected
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
AND password is written to the page
```
